# Genetic-Algorithm
Solving the Knapsack Problem using a Genetic Algorithm.

Description: Given a set of items, each with a specific weight and value, and a maximum weight capacity for the knapsack. Implement a genetic algorithm to find the combination of items that maximizes the total value without exceeding the weight capacity.

Initialize the Population: Generate an initial population of random solutions.

Fitness Calculation: Write a function to calculate the fitness of an individual based on the total value of items in the knapsack.

Selection: Implement tournament selection to select the fittest individuals for reproduction.

Crossover: Implement single-point crossover to combine pairs of individuals to produce offspring.

Mutation: Implement flip mutation to introduce random changes to the offspring.

Next Generation: Create the next generation by selecting parents, performing crossover, and applying mutation.

Find the Best Solution: Run the genetic algorithm for a fixed number of generations and find the best solution.
